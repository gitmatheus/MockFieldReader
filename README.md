<p align="center">Learn how to use dependency injection to mock read-only fields, such as formula fields and child relationships in your tests.</p>

</br>

A while ago we explored the [Mock Data Layer Pattern](https://github.com/gitmatheus/Mock-Data-Layer-Pattern), which allows us to mock virtually any relationships between records within your tests. This is especially handy when trying to improve the performance of these tests - more details on [matheus.dev](https://matheus.dev/unit-test-mock-relationships-apex/).

Now, how can we mock formula fields and <strong>read-only</strong> child relationships if they are, well, read-only fields? ü§î

## Mocking values in read-only fields

For this exploratory project, we will use a *not-so-realistic* scenario with parent and child accounts, but the intent is to create a test for the Account Trigger Handler that will use a <strong>Mock Field Reader</strong> and a <strong>Mock Data Layer</strong>.

The <strong>Mock Field Reader</strong> will be used so we can mock two <strong>read-only</strong> fields on the Account object.

- `Child_Accounts__r`, a read-only child relationship on the parent record
- `External_URL__c`, a formula field on the child record

The trigger handler logic will update the following field:
- `Parent.Latest_Child_URL__c`

Based on the following formula field:
- `Child.External_URL__c`

<h4>Getters</h4>

To respect the injected dependency, these methods must be present on both the real instance of the field reader ( `FieldReader` ) and the mock instance of the field reader ( `MockFieldReader` ).

<code>public Object getFieldValue(SObject record, String fieldName)</code>

This method is used to retrieve the mock values of formula fields. It returns an <code>Object</code> that can later be casted as different types, such as <code>String</code>, <code>Number</code>, <code>Id</code>, etc. 

<code>public SObject getFieldRecord(SObject record, String fieldName)</code>

This method is used to retrieve the mock values that represent a single record. It returns an <code>SObject</code>.

<code>public List<SObject> getFieldRecords(SObject record, String fieldName)</code>

This method is used to retrieve the mock values that represent a list of records, such as a child relationship. It returns a list of <code>SObjects</code>.

<h4>Setter</h4>

There's only one method used to set the values, and it's only present on the mock instance of the field reader ( `MockFieldReader` ).

<code>public void addValueToField(SObject record, String field, Object value)</code>

This method adds the field/value pair to a map of mocked values, indexed by the record Id.

<h4>Examples</h4>

In <a href="https://github.com/gitmatheus/MockFieldReader" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this repository</a> you will find a trigger handler class and its respective test class with the usage of this Mock Field Reader. 

<strong>Snippet from the AccountTriggerHandler</strong>: pay attention to how the following methods are being used:

<code>fieldReader.getFieldRecords(parentAndChildAccount, 'Child_Accounts__r');</code>
    
<code>fieldReader.getFieldValue(latestChild, 'External_URL__c');</code>

````
// Snippet from the AccountTriggerHandler

    ...

    // Child_Accounts__r is a nonwritable child relationship
    // Uses the field reader to retrieve the list of child records:
    List<Account> childRecords =
        fieldReader.getFieldRecords(parentAndChildAccount, 'Child_Accounts__r');

    if (childRecords != null && !childRecords.isEmpty()) {    
        Account latestChild = childRecords[0];

        // Updates the field Latest Child URL with the value from External_URL__c
        // External_URL__c is a formula field (nonwritable string)
        newRecord.Latest_Child_URL__c = 
            (String)fieldReader.getFieldValue(latestChild, 'External_URL__c');
    } 


````

And in the <strong>AccountTriggerHandlerTest</strong> you can see how these read-only fields can be mocked, using the method `addValueToField`:

````
    // Snippet from AccountTriggerHandlerTest

    ...
    mockDataLayer = new MockDataLayer();
    mockFieldReader = new MockFieldReader();
    ...

    // First, the formula field on the child object:
    mockFieldReader.addValueToField(
        mockDataLayer.childAccount,
        'External_URL__c',
        expectedURL
    );

    // Then, the nonwritable child relationship
    mockFieldReader.addValueToField(
        mockDataLayer.parentAccount, 
        'Child_Accounts__r', 
        new List<Account>{mockDataLayer.childAccount}
    );
````

With this code and the Mock Field Reader, it becomes easy to mock read-only fields used in the tests. 

I hope that helps!
